# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Submitting issues

Don't hesitate to create [GitHub issues](https://github.com/spotify/flink-on-k8s-operator/issues) for bugs, feature requests, or questions. When reporting a bug, it would help to include a small, reproducible code snippets, operator and kubernetes versions used.

## Submitting Pull Requests

If there is already a GitHub issue for the task you are working on, leave a comment to let people know that you are working on it. If there isn't already an issue and it is a non-trivial task, it's a good idea to create one (and note that you're working on it). This prevents contributors from duplicating effort.

## Contributing documentation

You can contribute to the operator, and the CRD documentation.

CRD documentation is available in `docs/crd.md` and is generated by scanning the export CRD types. To update this documentation you need to update the respective CRD types and run `make generte-crd-docs` from the root of the project to reflect those changes.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Spotify FOSS Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to honor this code.
